# Sales Data SQL Analysis

This repository contains a series of SQL queries and data analysis tasks I performed on a fictional `sales_data` and `customers` dataset. It showcases practical applications of SQL for analytics, including:

- RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Cohort Retention Analysis
- Customer Churn Detection
- Customer Segmentation

The tasks are written in MySQL syntax and designed to be run in MySQL Workbench or any compatible SQL environment.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Create the tables and insert sample data using `01_table_creation.sql`.
2. Execute each subsequent SQL file in order for end-to-end analysis.
3. All queries included comments to explain their purpose and logic.
